      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>&emsp;Hi, my name is Carter Jardine and I am currently a 20-year-old electrical engineering student. I live in beautiful British Columbia, Canada, and currently attend the University of British Columbia on the Okanagan Campus.<br>
      &emsp;I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and have a strong passion for building and creating things. 
      In my free time, I enjoy working on a variety of projects such as building and flying racing drones, building computers from scratch, and tinkering with microelectronics and PCB design. 
      I find these activities to be both challenging and rewarding, as they allow me to use my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. 
      In addition to my interests in technology, I also love spending time outdoors and enjoy fishing and camping in my free time. 
      I find that being in nature helps me to relax and recharge, and I find great satisfaction in the simple act of casting a line and waiting for a bite. Overall, I am a driven and curious individual who is always looking for new ways to learn and grow.</p>

      <p>&emsp;I recently completed a group project at university where we were given 4 months to design a complex 3D model. Our group decided to design a 144 ft yacht, and we put a lot of effort into making it as detailed and realistic as possible. We even went as far as designing the diesel engines for the yacht. 
      <br>&emsp;My part in the project was designing the hull, some decorative items, and the bow thrusters. I was also responsible for rendering the final model. We worked very hard on the project and were thrilled to place in the top 10 out of over 50 other groups. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I was proud of the work that we were able to accomplish as a team.<p>

      <p>Video Demonstrating Fluid Flow<p>
      <video src="Roller4.mp4" controls autoplay muted></video>
      <p>&emsp;In my university design project, I worked with a team to create a water rolling barrel that helps provide clean water to communities in Africa. Our goal was to assist with one of the United Nations' global goals, and we felt that this innovative solution could make a real difference in communities that rely on traditional methods of obtaining water.
        <br>&emsp;The water rolling barrel is a simple yet effective device that is designed to be rolled along the ground, much like a traditional barrel. As it rolls, the water inside is filtered, ensuring that it is clean and safe to drink. We focused on designing the barrel to be as efficient as possible, using advanced fluid simulations to optimize the flow of water through the filtering system.
        <br>&emsp;I was responsible for leading the design efforts on the project and working on the fluid simulations, while my team focused on the technical aspects and conducting research. We were able to complete the project within the allotted time frame. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world.<p>
