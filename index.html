    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>&emsp;Hi, my name is Carter Jardine and I am currently a 20-year-old electrical engineering student. <br><br>
      &emsp;I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and have a strong passion for building and creating things. 
      In my free time, I enjoy working on a variety of projects such as building and flying racing drones, building computers from scratch, and tinkering with microelectronics and PCB design. 
      I find these activities to be both challenging and rewarding, as they allow me to use my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. 
      In addition to my interests in technology, I also love spending time outdoors and enjoy fishing and camping in my free time. 
      I find that being in nature helps me to relax and recharge, and I find great satisfaction in the simple act of casting a line and waiting for a bite. 
      Overall, I am a driven and curious individual who is always looking for new ways to learn and grow.</p>
